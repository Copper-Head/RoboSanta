# RoboSanta
Make sure all kids big and small get their presents on time!

## Setup/Installation
The most convenient method to set things up is to run the following command
inside a virtual env of some sort:
```
pip install --editable .
```
This will install all the dependencies of this script *except pyclingo*.
Moreovera it will add `robosanta` to your PATH.
To find out what it does simply run:
```
robosanta --help
```

You can also run the script directly (provided you installed the dependencies manually):
```
python robosanta.py --help
```
